// Introduction

// Sports anime things

// Outlook and comedy
One of my few real complaints about Chihayafuru might be that it presents a very saccharine worldview, in which there are no evil people, and anything is possible with enough hard work.

// Characters

#### Season 2

With the second season of the anime, our main characters have moved into their second year of highschool, and they manage to scrape together a few new first-year recruits to the karuta club.
Tsukuba is quick to join the group, and while his glory-seeking sometimes puts him at odds with the other members, it does a lot to strengthen the storylines of the others, and even as an individual, he's an interesting character in his own right.
On the other hand, Sumire is not nearly as receptive to learning karuta, and her obsession with Taichi makes her one of the more annoying characters in the show by far.
However, her reluctant assimilation into the world of karuta is engaging, and while she still hasn't been entirely won over, her resistance makes her an interesting foil for an entire cast made up of karuta junkies.

Unfortunately, while the new characters are a good breath of fresh air, the second season feels significantly slower than the first for two reasons:
Firstly, a much larger portion of this season is devoted to the team competition, and matches go much more in-depth than they did in the first season.
Seeing our main characters fight so hard as a team is certainly appreciated, but eventually, it really does start to drag, and I think the second season suffers as a result.
Secondly, all of the original five Mizusawa players saw rapid growth as characters and/or as competitors in the first season, but they don't really have that same kind of development in the second season.
The original five players are still improving, of course, but they seem largely set in their same methodology and philosophy from the end of the last season, and the new players don't have the same amount of explosive improvement to make up for it.
