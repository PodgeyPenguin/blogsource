*Natsume Yuujinchou* is a slow-paced, slice-of-life story that follows Natsume Takashi, a highschool student that can see youkai, Japanese spirits.
Because of his unusual power and a magical book he inherited from his grandmother, Natsume constantly finds himself caught up in the youkai's affairs.
When he's not running from evil spirits, he's trying to help the good ones, all while trying to keep his ability a secret from his friends and family.

*Natsume Yuujinchou* is episodic, so the stories are largely self-contained, but it's still able to create a strong sense of continuity through its themes, from concepts as broad as "loyalty" or "unrequited love" to the more concrete relationships between humans and youkai, and between Natsume and his friends.
This is something the show does really well, and that sets it apart even from other slice-of-life series, in how every episode builds upon the show's themes and in the sheer number of themes, which are interwoven so that they build upon each other in turn.

Just for example, kindness is a recurring theme throughout the series; the show explores how Natsume's excessive kindness is a weakness that's often taken advantage of by others, but also how it's his greatest strength, in how he's able to make friends through his generosity and sincerity.
The theme of kindness reinforces the sense of division we see between the human and spirit worlds, because the youkai are always taken so aback by a human that treats them with respect, let alone someone like Natsume, who often goes out of his way to help them.
Natsume's kindness is also a reflection of his anxieties, and how years of bullying and isolation have led him to hold low self-esteem and a fear of losing his relationships.
In this way, Takashi is also put into direct contrast with his grandmother, who dealt with her own isolation by pushing people away and forcing youkai into submission, but then, even she had her own roundabout, awkward way of showing kindness.

Natsume is a well-rounded character; as likeable as he is, he still has flaws that he's aware of and working through.
Most of the other characters, however, are largely one-dimensional because so much of their characterization is only shown through their relationships with Natsume himself.
But even if your favorite side-characters feel underused, this works well in centering the series around Natsume and emphasizing his personal development.

The individual episodes themselves vary a lot in quality.
There are several episodes in which the actual events aren't terribly interesting, which have to rely on your investment in the characters and again, in the themes.
On the other hand, there are just as many fantastic episodes.
The show strikes a strong balance of drama, catharsis, humor, and heartbreak, and many times, just the worldbuilding is intriguing enough to pull you in.

The show takes place in a rural suburb, surrounded by nature and rooted in Shinto and Buddhist tradition.
The folk setting is then reinforced with string and woodwind instrumentals, a muted pastel color palette, and the strolling pace of the story itself.
Blending these qualities together, the show feels laidback and comfortable, and at the same time, it evokes a bittersweet sense of nostalgia and wistfulness.

It's certainly not for everyone, because it *is* on the slower side, and some of the episodes don't stand up well on their own, but that's the worst I can say, because overall, *Natsume Yuujinchou* is a beautiful series that's definitely worth a watch if you enjoy world-building, slice-of-life, and coming-of-age stories.

#### Manga

The anime is quite a faithful adaptation of the manga, so if you enjoy the anime, you're sure to like the manga for the same reasons, or vice versa.
Unfortunately, the manga doesn't have a soundtrack, voice acting, or color, and the artstyle is fairly different, and I think for that, the manga lacks some of the atmospheric immersion the anime has, but then, the same can be said for most manga that get adaptations.
Also, because the manga chapters and anime episodes have different lengths, certain stories work better in one medium than the other, as a result of differing pacing and amount of content, so it might be worth your time to both read and watch *Natsume Yuujinchou*.
Additionally, there's still a lot of material that the anime has yet to cover, even after four seasons (and a fifth in the works), and with that much additional content, Natsume's character is given that much more room to grow.
Even though the manga feels a little more raw and unpolished than the anime, the stories are still lovely and absolutely worth checking out.

#### Hotarubi no Mori e

Both a manga oneshot and an anime OVA by the same author (and anime studio), *Hotarubi no Mori e* doesn't have any in-universe connection to *Natsume Yuujinchou*.
However, it could be called a spiritual side-story, because it shares the same production style/quality, and it handles both romance and Japanese folklore in much the same way that *Natsume Yuujinchou* does.
Also, I think that although the plot of *Hotarubi no Mori e* is nothing particularly fresh, it's executed so well that it's very much a treat to watch/read, and if it *were* canonically part of *Natsume Yuujinchou*, I would consider it one of the best episodes.
