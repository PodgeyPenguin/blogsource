*Kimi to Boku* is an easygoing slice-of-life anime that captures the nostalgia and anxiety of growing up, and puts you back in the shoes of adolescence.
There's not much to say about the plot itself; it's mostly just about the everyday lives of a group of highschool kids, but it's masterful in crafting its atmosphere.
In following the relatively mundane day-to-day, it becomes easy to relate to the show and let its wistful, sighing tone sweep you away.

Rather than uplifting vignettes or gag comedy, as seems pretty typical of episodic, slice-of-life anime, *Kimi to Boku* is actually quite refreshing in how its tone is a bit more somber.
The series does have humorous moments, and some episodes revolve around comedy more than others, but even though the show exists in this comedic framework, it ultimately feels like a sideshow to the more serious plot elements.
Really, what the show concentrates most of its energy on is painting scenes that draw out all the naivete and nervousness of learning to grow up; from far away, it can almost seem petty, but to the cast, it's their entire world, and it reminds me of my own wandering, restless youth.

In its endearing portrayal of the everyday, *Kimi to Boku* crafts a beautiful atmosphere built on nostalgia.
Even as the days go by, the cast members know just as well as we do that nothing lasts forever, and as such, the show is shaded by their uncertainties about the future looming on the horizon, whichs is compounded by their relationships with older characters.
While looking towards the future, the show also takes us back into the characters' early childhood memories, which carry just as much regret as they do happy remembrance.
The remorse for the past and the unease about the future feel almost too familiar for comfort, and what's more, they help frame the present as all the more fleeting.
Even the show's soundtrack, which can seem peppy at first blush, carries its own sense of bittersweet nostalgia for days long past. 
The mood set by the show is equal parts cheerful and pensive, and that kind of nuanced duality of tone is exciting to experience in its own way.

The other big talking point I want to hit on about *Kimi to Boku* is how it handles romance.
It's hard to say that *Kimi to Boku* really falls into the "romance" genre, because that's not the main focus of the writing for the majority of the series, but there are still several episodes that do focus on romance, and the show handles that romance really well in my opinion.
Almost all of the characters' crushes go unrequited, and that bittersweet longing they that sets the tone even further: young innocence, nostalgic regret, future anxieties, and present ephemerality, it's all there.
Regardless of whether it works out though, all of the romance is naive and a bit bumbling, which makes it charming and relatable, without being so over-the-top that it becomes a chore to watch.
Additionally, it's just nice to see romance take on a significant role in the show without taking over the entire story or feeling tacked on.

I will say that *Kimi to Boku* is divisive because of how slowly the plot moves.
If you're typically lukewarm to slice-of-life series in general because they feel slow or inconsequential, then honestly, you'll probably loathe this show.
On the other hand, if you typically enjoy slower-paced series, or your reasons for being on the fence about slice-of-life are that they feel like unrealistic escapism or perhaps because they're often too focused on jokes, then I would definitely recommend *Kimi to Boku*.
One last thing is that the first episode is particularly bland, and I would hope that if you give it a try, check out at least the first three episodes before really deciding whether to continue or not, because it takes time for the characters to grow into themselves.
Overall, *Kimi to Boku* is a joy to watch; it feels almost like being on summer vacation again, as you let the days slip away, taking in all the sights and sounds, and hoping for it to last just a little bit longer.
