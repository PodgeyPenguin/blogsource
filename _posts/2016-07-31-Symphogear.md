"Interdimensional monsters are attacking, and they can only be stopped by highschool girls in battle armor that's powered by singing!"
*Senki Zesshou Symphogear* is a balls-to-the-wall action series that takes over-the-top cheesiness to its absolute limits.

*Symphogear* is about facing your inner demons, trusting your friends, yada-yada-yada, and most importantly, punching the crap out of bad guys.
Whether they're mowing down alien blobs or fighting other "gear" users, the characters in *Symphogear* know how to put on a show.
All of the action in *Symphogear* can be summed up with three questions: "Is it cool?", "Is it maybe just stupid enough to work?", and "Okay, but can we make it bigger?"

Even when we take a break from the weird stupidity that passes for fighting, *Symphogear* continues to entertain with its sense of humor.
There are various small gags throughout the series, but usually, the humor comes from the main character, Hibiki, and her voice actress, Yuuki Aoi, who really shines when portraying such a goofy girl.

Unfortunately, the world of *Symphogear* isn't all sunshine and rainbows: everyone gets a turn in the melodrama hotseat, and it's not spectacularly well-written.
Also, since the rest of the series is full of action and comedy, the drama is jarring at first, almost like a bait-and-switch, where you were promised powersuits and explosions, but ended up having to watch highschool girls argue.
That said, the drama does exactly what it needs to: it moves the plot and character development forward.

Once you accept the drama as a necessary evil, you come to realize that *Symphogear* actually does a great job of balancing the fun parts with the serious stuff.
Dramatic conflicts are stewed over just long enough to give them weight, and then resolved early enough to make more room for punching.

Also, *Symphogear* builds tension up to its main plot "twist" in a fantastic way that I don't often see in fiction.
I don't want to spoil too much, but *Symphogear* clues you in very obviously to the plot twist, so you get to see how the heroes are being taken advantage of while they remain clueless.
A lot of times, you don't get to see the bad guy's machinations until after the fact, so even if you have a creeping suspicion, that's all it really is.
In this case, you know exactly what's going on, and you get to watch from the heroes' point of view, knowing how they're getting played.

Finally, I hate to admit it, but *Symphogear* suffers from some seriously low budget, especially in the first season, and even after Blu-ray cleanups, there are a lot of ugly keyframes.
Still, at least personally, that's not nearly enough to kill my enjoyment of the show.

In summary, the writing is ridiculous, the characters are balls of angst, and the animation cuts corners, but Symphogear is just too busy kicking ass to care.
The pacing, humor, and sheer absurdity of the series will keep you laughing in amazement and begging for more.

#### Season 2

I was really excited when *Symphogear G* started airing, but it quickly devolved into a nonsensical mess.
Now look, *Symphogear* is crazy and stupid by definition, yes, but I never thought of Season 1 as convoluted; it was straightforward and did exactly what it needed, when it needed.
Whereas Season 1 was able to take its time with each character's drama, Season 2 introduces several new characters, and every seems to have their own thing going on, so all of the subplots come out feeling rushed and incomplete.
On top of that, the plot also moves way too fast: characters are gaining powers, losing powers, and switching sides every episode, so everything feels inconsequential and forgettable.

#### Season 3

*Symphogear GX* started out feeling like Season 1, but in the end, left me with the same bitter aftertaste as Season 2.
The anime staff realized after Season 2 that it was bogged down by too many storylines with the inclusion of enemy gear users, so in Season 3, we have a single main villain with robotic doll minions, so we get to meet a bunch of new, badass enemies, but we can just concentrate on the main villain's storyline.
In addition, the pacing seemed to have returned to Season 1 levels of hype, switching between drama and action in good stride.

However, somewhere in the middle, the season just fizzled out for me.
The character subplots were boring, and a lot of them felt like retreading old ground, especially Hibiki's, which is carried over from Season 2 and extended for far too long; even the main plot started to feel like a drag, to the point that the action was almost a chore to sit through.
I really wish Season 3 had been able to keep up until the end, but still, the first half really felt like a true successor to Season 1 in a way Season 2 never did, and that gives me real hope for the future, since Seasons 4 *and 5* have been announced!
